# SILO - Simple Integrated Land-Use Orchestrator

This repository contains a JIBE-specific implementation of the Java-based [SILO](https://github.com/msmobility/silo) software for modelling travel demand, developed through a multi-intstitutional collaboration between researchers at the Technical University of Munich (TUM), University of Cambridge's Public Health Modelling team, and RMIT University's Centre for Urban Research.

The main branch has [merged code](https://github.com/msmobility/silo/tree/transportHealthIntegrationModel_jibe) developed by Qin Zhang and Corin Staves for the JIBE project's [Manchester](https://github.com/jibeproject/silo/tree/main/useCases/manchester/src/main/java/de/tum/bgu/msm) implementation, with further health model development by Ismaïl Saadi, Ali Abbas, Tabea Sonnenschein, and Marina Berdikhanova, and implementation of the Melbourne use-case scenarios by Carl Higgs.  Project CIs are Belen Zapata-Diomedi and Prof James Woodcock.

# SILO Model

## Project Overview

**Repository:** jibeproject/silo  
**Description:** SILO Model Java Code  
**License:** GNU General Public License

### What is SILO?

SILO stands for **Simple Integrated Land-Use Orchestrator**. It is a sophisticated Java-based microsimulation model designed to simulate population, housing, and land-use dynamics. The model can simulate behavioral changes in households and individuals over time, making it suitable for public health modeling, urban planning, and transportation analysis.
